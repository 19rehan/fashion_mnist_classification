# 👗 Fashion MNIST Classification with Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates image classification on the **Fashion MNIST dataset**, a benchmark dataset consisting of **70,000 grayscale images** of clothing items across **10 categories** (e.g., T-shirt, Trouser, Dress, Sneaker).  

The goal is to build and evaluate a **deep learning model** that can accurately classify fashion items, showcasing practical applications of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**.
